        It was officially opened on September 30, 2005. Many call it Valdebebas
        due to its location in the Valdebebas district of Madrid. The project
        was designed by architect Carlos Lamela, and the inauguration was
        attended by Real Madrid's Honorary President, Alfredo Di Stéfano, and
        Emilio Butragueño, Head of Protocol and Public Relations. The sports
        city covers approximately 1,067 hectares of land, and part of
        Madrid-Barajas Airport can be seen from its facilities. The sports city
        covers an area of ​​approximately 1,200,000 square meters, which is ten
        times the size of the previous sports city and 40 times the size of the
